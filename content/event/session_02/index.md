**Chair** Kamilla Kopec-Harding

**Talk 1** "Getting Things Done With gt Table" 
with speaker **Rowan Green**

**Talk 2** "User-defined functions to create summary tables" with speaker Lucy Njoki Njuki 

In environments like Microsoft Azure that do not support the default viewer mode, utilising tabulation packages like gtsummary becomes impractical. In this example, I will demonstrate, the use of user-defined functions to summarise data in such environments, using knitr::kable() to beautify the resulting tables.
