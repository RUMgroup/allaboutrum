bio:
  speaker_1: |
    Toni is a Research Software Engineer at the University of Manchester.

    Imagine your R code as a polished, reusable tool that you can share with colleagues, collaborators or the entire R community. In this talk youâ€™ll learn how to create a fully functional, tested and documented R package step-by-step the easy way with `devtools`, `usethis`, `testthat` and `roxygen2` in RStudio. Throw in a documentation website built with `pkgdown` and advice from `goodpractice` to streamline your workflow -- and take your R skills to the next level!
