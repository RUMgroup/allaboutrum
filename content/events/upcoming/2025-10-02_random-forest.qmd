bio:
  speaker_1: |
    Chris is a postdoctoral research associate in the Agriculture, Water and
    Climate group within the Civil Engineering &amp; Management department.
    Starting out as a wheat breeder following his plant science background,
    Chris returned to his hometown of Manchester to complete his PhD in
    modelling crop responses to the changing monsoonal climate of India. His
    research is now centred on developing and applying open-source crop-water
    modelling tools to support assessment of risks to agriculture at basin to
    global scales.

    Heard of Random Forests and aren't sure where to start? Or have you always
    wanted to apply machine learning to a problem but are worried about the
    'black box' nature of the models? This talk will introduce one of the most
    interpretable and accessible machine learning algorithms, Random Forests.
    Beginning with a straightforward description of the model's structure, this
    talk will then cover everything you need to start running your own Random
    Forest models in R: from data preparation, variable selection, and types of
    Random Forest models &#8212; to plotting and interpreting outputs and
    accuracy measures. By the end of the session, you'll be branching out into
    machine learning with confidence!
