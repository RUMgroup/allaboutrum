<!-- Current team member -->

I am a Research Software Engineer at the University of Manchester with a background in 
GIS and Biogeography. R was the first programming language I learned, and 
I initially used it as a Geographic Information System for mapping and spatial analysis, 
particularly in species and disease distribution modelling. I was deeply impressed with R's capabilities for such complicated analysis.

This experience solidified my passion for spatial data and sparked a deeper interest 
in programming, leading me to explore software development alongside GIS.
