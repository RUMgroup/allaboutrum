<!-- Current team member -->

As a Research Software Engineer at the University of Manchester I regularly help
researchers write and debug R programs used in research and help out in R
training sessions and workshops provided by Research IT. I have been involved
with R.U.M. from the start and enjoy fostering collaboration and skill sharing
among R enthusiasts and academics.
